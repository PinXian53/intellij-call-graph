<b>Intellij Call Graph</b> is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that analyzes your project’s source code and extracts method-to-method call relationships. 
It helps developers and architects better understand the structure and dependencies within their codebase.

## Features

Automatically detects and maps which methods call which, across your entire project.

### 📄 Export to CSV
Easily export analyzed data for further processing in Excel, scripts, or custom analysis tools.

### 🌐 Export to Cypher (Neo4j)
Generate Cypher queries to import method relationships into a Neo4j graph database for rich visual analysis and graph-based querying.

### ⚙️ Simple to Use
Just select the folder or file you want to analyze in the Project View, then right-click and choose "Export Call Graph" – select your preferred output format.
